# reverse-engineer

This is a homework assignment for Case Western Reserve University Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment is to go through code we are given and to explain what does what and why, and correct any code that we can to make it more efficient. This is a real world assignment as realistically there will be code that we will have to look at that has previously been written and figure out how to make it work, improve it, and make it more efficient.
